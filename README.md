If you're like me and hate defacing the scenery just to get sand, why don't you use quartz instead?

## Create Glass from Quartz

**Step 1.** Get Quartz

**Step 2.** Shove some into a crucible (where does this crucible come from, you ask? Don't worry about it. Soon it will be gone.)

**Step 3.** Put this crucible in a furnace

And voil√†! (You'll notice it grants a bit more XP than smelting Sand into Glass.)

## Break Quartz blocks into Quartz

"Full" Quartz blocks will give you 4 Quartz back and "half" Quartz blocks (stairs and slabs) will give you 2 Quartz back. Fair enough, right?

## Amethyst is Quartz

And therefore, you should be able to get Glass from it. Purple Glass!

![3 Amethyst Shards in a row give 1 Amethyst Crucible](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/GoXq0Lhf/images/a2d28c9aebe321c7dacf824d7ff0e7e88a93f49b.png) ![Smelting Amethyst Crucibles give you Purple Glass](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/GoXq0Lhf/images/30782a26f033f65544c3ebfd9ad35157f03d96d0.png)

But if you'd like, you can also mix and match Amethyst Shards with Quartz. Using 2 Amethyst Shards with 1 Quartz will allow you to create Magenta Glass:

![2 Amethyst Shards + 1 Quartz = 1 Magenta Crucible](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/GoXq0Lhf/images/100969963a8239bc3fe47aa06665af3f141dcf22.png) ![Smelting Magenta Crucibles gives you Magenta Glass](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/GoXq0Lhf/images/66454873fe8c0fa86186c3aa83b4c636f3fb742d.png)

Whereas using 2 Quartz with 1 Amethyst Shard will allow you to create Pink Glass:

![2 Quartz + 1 Amethyst Shard = 1 Pink Crucible](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/GoXq0Lhf/images/b73c4338354d8dae521aa20feddd6e76000bc786.png) ![Smelting Pink Crucibles will create Pink Glass](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/GoXq0Lhf/images/31f260e471b08b2f49eb27424aef9729032554cd.png)

## Break Amethyst Blocks into Amethyst Shards

You don't need to place Amethyst Blocks down to break them with your pickaxe anymore:

## Turn Soul Sand into Tinted Glass

Soul Sand _is_ sand, isn't it? So we should be able to get some kind of glass out of it! Since Soul Sand is an edgy version of Sand, you should be able to smelt it into the edgy version of Glass: Tinted Glass.

![Smelting 1 Soul Sand gives 1 Tinted Glass](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/GoXq0Lhf/images/b8c0e7ef57e151ab61447bb1b0513afc0a14b2c3.png)

And that's it for this mod. I hope you'll find it helpful.

Tested with Fabric API 0.91.0+1.20.1

This mod is provided "as is". It should technically work on all
1.20.X versions of the game. I am not planning to update/backport this
mod to a different version of Minecraft. You're free to do so yourself,
however.
